%u	It is used to print the unsigned integer value where the unsigned integer means that the variable can hold 
          only positive value.
%o	It is used to print the octal unsigned integer where octal integer value always starts with a 0 value.
%x	It is used to print the hexadecimal unsigned integer where the hexadecimal integer value always starts

%p	It is used to print the address in a hexadecimal form.
%c	It is used to print the unsigned character.
