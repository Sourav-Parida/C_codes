1.)Why do computers understand only binary language?
A.) Computers are made up of many hardware objects like processor,ram and many more.
    computer hardwares are mostly made up of diodes which operates in 2 ways only i.e.on and off state.
    the hard ware which are not made up of diaode also works only in on/off state.
    in on state current is flowing through diode and in off state current is not flowing through the diode.
    so computers only understande the binary language. in which 1 represent on and 0 represent off.

2.)What is the full form of IDE?
A.)  Integrated development environment.

3.)What is the difference between a text editor and a code editor?
A.)a text editor used to edit the text only it does not hepl us to write code. 
the code editor helps to write code it is also a text editor.

4.)What are the steps to develop software using the C language?
i) create source file.
ii) build software.-a.)compiler compile the text file.

5.)What is the latest version of C Language?
A.) C17,upcomming C23
b. Who developed C Language?
A.) Dennis Ritchie
c. What is the difference between System and Application Software?
A.)           System Software
i./ System software is used for operating computer hardware.
ii./ System softwares are installed on the computer when operating system is installed.
iii./ The user does not interact with system software because it works in the background.
Some examples of system softwares are compiler, assembler, debugger, driver, etc.
             Application Software
i./ Application software is used by user to perform specific task.
ii./ Application softwares are installed according to user’s requirements.
iii./ The user interacts with application sofwares.
iv./ Application software can’t run independently. They can’t run without the presence of system software.
Some examples of application softwares are word processor, web browser, media player, etc.

d. How to convert a number from a decimal number system to a binary number
system?
A.1.)
i./Take decimal number as dividend.
ii./ Divide this number by 2 (2 is base of binary so divisor here).
iii./ Store the remainder in an array (it will be either 0 or 1 because of divisor 2).
iv./ Repeat the above two steps until the number is greater than zero.
v./ Print the array in reverse order (which will be equivalent binary number of given decimal number)
                    remainder
eg. 169/2= 84           1
    84/2 = 42           0
    42/2 = 21		0
    21/2 = 10		1
    10/2 = 5		0
    5/2  = 2		1
    2/2  = 1		0
    1/2  = 0		1
                                    so binary is 10101001
A.2.)
i./ Take decimal number as multiplicand.
ii/ Multiple this number by 2 (2 is base of binary so multiplier here).
iii./ Store the value of integer part of result in an array (it will be either 0 or 1 because of multiplier 2).
iv./ Repeat the above two steps until the number became zero.
v./Print the array (which will be equivalent fractional binary number of given decimal fractional number)
   
e.g.
0.81252 x 2= 1.625	1
0.6252 x 2= 1.25	1
0.252 x 2= 0.50		0
0.52 x 2= 1.0		1
0 x 2 = 0		0

A.3.)
i./ Look for the greatest power of 2.
ii./ Move to the next lower power of two.
iii./ Subtract each successive number that can fit, and mark it with a 1.
iv./ Continue until you reach the end of your chart.
v./ Write out the binary answer

e.g.Subtract given number 205 from maximum possible power of 2,
= 205 - 128 = 77
Put 1 in box of 128 (= 27), then again subtract remaining number 77 from maximum possible power of 2,
= 77 - 64 =13
Put 1 in box of 64 (= 26), then repeat above steps,
= 13 - 8 =5
= 5 - 4 =1
= 1 - 1 =0
And put a 0 in remaining boxes.
